        <p>
          As this workshop has grown, I’ve relied on Copilot as a thinking
          partner and a second set of hands. Somewhere along the way, I got
          tired of referring to tools, systems, and subsystems by long
          descriptions—so I started giving them names.
        </p>

        <p>
          I don’t name every tool in the shop. The drill press is just the drill
          press. But when there are two lasers, two CNC routers, or a system
          with multiple subsystems, names help keep the roles straight. They
          turn a pile of hardware into a constellation of collaborators I can
          think about clearly.
        </p>

        <p>
          That’s how Amanda, Rae, Smokie, BRAINS, and POWER came to be. Their
          names aren’t for whimsy—they’re for clarity. Each one marks a specific
          function in the workshop’s ecosystem. Smokie, for example, is the
          three‑drawer electrical cabinet that houses the power supplies and
          motor controllers. Her name comes from the old electronics joke:
          everything runs on ‘magic smoke,’ and if you let the smoke out, the
          equipment dies.
        </p>

        <p>
          Naming only happens when it reduces ambiguity or defines a role. It’s
          how I keep a growing workshop organized, maintainable, and expandable
          without losing the plot.
