    <h1>The Workshop Gallery</h1>

    <p>
      As this workshop has grown, I’ve relied on Copilot as a thinking partner
      and a second set of hands. Somewhere along the way, I got tired of
      referring to tools, systems, and subsystems by long descriptions — so I
      started giving them names.
    </p>

    <p>
      I don’t name every tool in the shop. The drill press is just the drill
      press. But when there are two lasers, two CNC routers, or a system with
      multiple subsystems, names help keep the roles straight. They turn a pile
      of hardware into a constellation of collaborators I can think about
      clearly.
    </p>

    <p>
      That’s how Amanda, Rae, Smokie, Brains, and Power came to be. Their names
      aren’t for whimsy—they’re for clarity. Each one marks a specific function
      in the workshop’s ecosystem.
    </p>

    <p>
      Naming only happens when it reduces ambiguity or defines a role. It’s how
      I keep a growing workshop organized, maintainable, and expandable without
      losing the plot.
